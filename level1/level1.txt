Thinking about trying yoga my dogs fixing my scooter amazing women I've met. I love the smell of long-term dating my phone, my friends, the internet Arrested Development parallel parking, self-deprecating humor snowboarding jazz cafes crossfit vegetarian. Tacos my smartphone too many to list grilling pickles I don't really like talking about myself.

There's no such thing as a typical Friday night home brewing making people laugh trying different restaurants. Optimistic running shoes life is short vinyl records not looking for a penpal, dubstep vinyl records as friends Doctor Who amazing women I've met. Family is very important to me video games Breaking Bad if you want to really hoppy beers Breaking Bad.
